<description>Capturing the natural beauty of chemistry

I find that chemistry is often taught poorly or without a purpose. Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. In each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to capture the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways.

In terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab, and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job!

All chemicals must be disposed of properly. Everything will be contaminated with mercury/mercury salts. NOTHING CAN GO DOWN THE DRAIN OR IN THE GARBAGE. Only carry out this experiment if you can dispose of the chemicals and combustion products properly.

Every step of this synthesis deals with dangerous or toxic materials. Gloves, safety glasses and a lab coat are mandatory.

Here is a video to show you how volatile elemental mercury is. It lets off a lot of vapor and breathing this must be avoided.

<title>Fuming Nitric Acid vs. Lab Gloves</title>

<description>Duration: 01:17 (77s)<br/>Views: 159280<br/>Likes: 1982<br/><br/>Fuming nitric acid is defined as having a concentration of HNO3 greater than 86%. This is much higher than the conventional 68% of common lab nitric acid.

The reaction between the nitric acid and the nitrile and latex gloves is extremely exothermic and violent. It is often recommended to avoid using gloves altogether when working with fuming nitric acid unless resistant gloves are available (e.g. butyl rubber gloves).
Regular concentrated nitric acid is still not good to use with latex gloves. Latex offers little to no protection. Nitric acid can quickly penetrate the glove and then irritate skin.

Fuming nitric acid is not nearly as common and it is used in much fewer reactions. For example, for the synthesis of high explosives. The high concentration of HNO3 is required in order to nitrate a molecule several times. For example, TNT, or tri-nitrotuluene, is prepared using fuming nitric acid. It is possible to di-nitrate it using concentrated nitric acid, but the third nitration is unlikely to occur, so yield will be zero or uselessly low.</description>

Note: My dehydration reaction did not work nearly as nicely as other videos. I just found however, a link explaining how the reaction should be carried out. Here is the link: http://firstyear.chem.usyd.edu.au/demonstrations/files/10.12.pdf

It suggests using much more sulfuric acid than I did and to stir the mixture.

Magnesium silicide reacts with HCl to produce silane gas. Silane gas is pyrophoric, which means that it spontaneously combusts in contact with air at temperatures below 54C. The silane gas erupts into flames when it contacts air and makes small popping noises.</description>

(Copied from the other nitric acid video)
Fuming nitric acid is defined as having a concentration of HNO3 greater than 86%. This is much higher than the conventional 68% of common lab nitric acid.

The reaction between the nitric acid and the nitrile and latex gloves is extremely exothermic and violent. It is often recommended to avoid using gloves altogether when working with fuming nitric acid unless resistant gloves are available (e.g. butyl rubber gloves or Ansell brand laminated film gloves which were suggested by user Atomosphysica). Regular concentrated nitric acid is still not good to use with latex gloves. Latex offers little to no protection. Nitric acid can quickly penetrate the glove and then irritate skin.

Fuming nitric acid is not nearly as common and it is used in much fewer reactions. For example, for the synthesis of high explosives.

<title>How to make cadaverine (the smell of death)</title>

<description>Duration: 08:30 (510s)<br/>Views: 191275<br/>Likes: 2720<br/><br/>Warning: Cadaverine is absolutely putrid and it taints everything that it comes into contact with. It also does not wash off too easily. 

This video was more of a proof of concept than an actual synthesis. The amount of lysine and sodium bicabonate used was relatively arbitrary.

In this video I use two methods to produce cadaverine:

1. Basic heating: This is not very efficient and burns a lot of the cadaverine. 

2. Destructive distillation: I use an improvised destructive distillation setup. This method is much more efficient because it is carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Higher temperatures can be used without risking burning. 

I honestly did not proceed further in the second method because of the putrid smell. A lot more cadaverine was produced and the smell was making me nauseous.

The lysine hydrochloride can be purchased from health supplement stores. I got 250g for about $17 shipped from www.purebulk.com</description>

<description>Duration: 03:26 (206s)<br/>Views: 88727<br/>Likes: 1279<br/><br/>Acetylsalicylic is readily available in Aspirin tablets. Chemically, it is a useful molecule. It can be converted to salicylic acid and then phenol, which is an extremely useful precursor. Also, the salicylic acid itself can be used to make the minty smelling wintergreen. 

All in all, acetylsalicylic acid is a quite desirable chemical. However, before it can be used in any reaction, it must first be separated from the Aspirin pills, which contains binders and fillers. In this video, I will outline one method of separating the acetylsalicylic acid (also referred to as ASA) from pills.

The final yield of ASA from 500 325mg tablets was 152g (or about 94%).</description>

The melting temperature of sulfur is much lower than the ignition temperature. So first, the sulfur melts and then burns in it's liquid phase. What is interesting is that the characteristic yellow color of sulfur disappears. When the sulfur is melted, it liquefies to a blood red goop.

http://www1.chem.leeds.ac.uk/delights/texts/expt_11.html

I did not mention it in the video, but the manganese sulfate is added to provide Mn2+ ions. These Mn2+ ions catalyze 2 steps of the radical process by acting as a reducing agent in one step and as an oxidization agent in another. More information about this can be found in the link that I provided above.</description>

In this video, we will be using acetic anhydride to acetylate 1-pentanol to make banana flavoring.

The same reaction can be carried out on several other alcohols, however, to make other scents, such as mushroom, orange, or pear.

<description>Duration: 04:51 (291s)<br/>Views: 44918<br/>Likes: 615<br/><br/>In this video, I will be making n-bromopropane by brominating 1-propanol. The n-bromopropane can then be used in a Grignard reaction to make butyric acid (smell of vomit). 

Here is the video of me using it in a Grignard reaction: http://youtu.be/_wmx65zQk58

This process can be used as a general procedure to produce bromoalkane. For example, it can be used to make n-bromobutane, which can then be used to make n-Butyl Lithium.</description>

<title>How to make Alcohol at Home (Ethanol)</title>
<link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txm7eu8KxVI</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">youtube:video:txm7eu8KxVI</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 20:42:08 +0000</pubDate>
<description>Duration: 08:21 (501s)<br/>Views: 7203963<br/>Likes: 80672<br/><br/>REUPLOADED DUE TO SOUND ISSUE.

This is a very basic way that you can make your own DRINKABLE ethanol at home. The main premise of this video is to show just how simple and easy it is to ferment your own alcohol. In a future video, I will try to dispel some myths regarding homebrewing, such as the exaggerated risk of methanol poisoning. I will also demonstrate how easy and safe it can be to distill your own ethanol from the wash that you produce.

In this video, I prepare a sugar wash (fermentation of sugar only). The process is similar to the preparation of wine or beer, but uses pure table sugar instead of a variety of different sugars, fruits or other additives. Also, more yeast is used in order to speed things up a little.

The final product should be ready in a week or two. If you want to drink it, you can. Just clear it first using a clearing solution and clean the taste up using activated carbon. It still won't taste very good though.

Be aware that there are some things that when added might be dangerous. So, please, if you decide to add something to the fermentation, please verify beforehand that it is safe.

Here are some calculators to calculate how much sugar you need to make a certain amount of alcohol - http://homedistiller.org/sugar/wash-sugar/yield

NOTE - For a sugar wash, you probably don't need to sterilize anything. Just wash it with soap and water. The presence of other microbes can alter the taste if you plan to drink it.

WARNING - Depending on where you live, making or distilling alcohol can be illegal without the proper permits or licenses.

Warning: H2S is EXTREMELY toxic. Do NOT do this indoors and avoid using H2S if you can. 

In this video, I generate hydrogen sulfide using hydrochloric acid (HCl) and iron sulfide (FeS).

I bubble the gas through a saturated solution of copper sulfate to limit the amount of H2S released into the environment and to demonstrate it's (old) use as an analytical chemistry technique.</description>

In this video we make diethyl ether from ethanol and sulfuric acid. I adapted by procedure from YouTube user myst32YT. Here is a link to his ether synthesis video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytdO3YzXNkQ

I also used this as a resource: http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=9747

The final product likely still has a little bit of a water in it. I would suggest adding more drying agent or molecular sieves if you need it to be anhydrous.

In this video I separate DCM from paint/varnish remover using a fractional distillation. You can also separate it via simple distillation if you do not have a column. 

I obtained about 260mL of methylene chloride from a bottle of 500mL of gel paint remover.

<title>How to isolate Vanillin from Artificial Vanilla Extract</title>
<link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skS8SKJrZYc</link>

<description>Duration: 03:57 (237s)<br/>Views: 129755<br/>Likes: 1584<br/><br/>In this video, vanillin is isolated from artificial vanilla extract. The solvent used is dichloromethane, but it is likely better to use diethyl ether as it does not form an emulsion. I used dichloromethane because it is easier to obtain for most people.

It is important to use artificial vanilla and not real vanilla extract. The real vanilla extract contains many more compounds.

The amount of vanillin in commercially available extracts is widely variable and usually ranges between 1g-4g per 500mL volume. 

This video was inspired by Youtube user myst32YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ZDSFEsrGg

<description>Duration: 06:36 (396s)<br/>Views: 108841<br/>Likes: 1433<br/><br/>This method was borrowed from both Youtuber users NurdRage and UC235.

In this video we will be extracting DEHP from vinyl gloves, and then cleaving the ester bonds to form alcohols and phthalic acid. The phthalic acid is then converted to phthalic anhydride by dehydration and sublimation.

This phthalic anhydride will be used in further synthesis to make phenolphthalein and phthalimide (precursor to anthranilic acid).

<description>Duration: 05:01 (301s)<br/>Views: 346461<br/>Likes: 5666<br/><br/>In this video, phenolphthalein is synthesized by the condensation of phenol and phthalic anhydride. The phenolphthalein is separated from starting materials by several washing steps. 

In theory you can also just extract the phenolphthalein from the reaction mixture using NaOH solution. This will pull out the phenolphthalein as well as the phenol. Then when the phenolphthalein is crashed out, the phenol should stay in solution. Then recrystallize. Much faster method.

The process is very slow and long. It is much easier to simply buy glycerol from the store. It would be much faster and much more pure than making it yourself.

Glycerine can be made from triglycerides in vegetable oils. Most bio-fats are stored as triglycerides which are made of 3 fatty acids and a glycerol backbone. This is the same method as making biodiesel from vegetable oil. where glycerine is normally considered a by-product.

<description>Duration: 06:08 (368s)<br/>Views: 2107019<br/>Likes: 48022<br/><br/>In this video I will be synthesizing benzene from sodium benzoate and sodium hydroxide.

This procedure was taken from the ScienceMadness forum: http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=325

The ratios of reactants used and the method of using the can was suggested by Organikum.

I forgot to mention in the video, but if you use glass, it does not conduct well and depending on how much you use, the glass can crack when cooling.

This is just a quick video on how to make a phenolphthalein indicator solution. A few drops of this solution can be used as an indicator in acid base titrations or other pH dependent applications.

2Cl- -- 2e = Cl2
2H2O - 4e = 4H+ + O2

This was an oversight on my part and I am glad he was able to point this out!

In this video we will be growing some tin crystals using a stannous chloride solution and some electrolysis.

<description>Duration: 06:47 (407s)<br/>Views: 3570520<br/>Likes: 64687<br/><br/>We will be extracting some caffeine from coffee today! I used regular coffee grounds, but I think the process is actually faster and easier with instant coffee.

In theory the yield should have been hovering around 300mg if ALL the caffeine was removed. However, I got around 10% of that (30mg). Apparently 10g makes about a cup of coffee, so a yield of 30mg isn't that horrible.

Industrially, the caffeine is made synthetically and not extracted because it isn't really economical. The only time caffeine is extracted is for making decaffeinated coffee. But in that case, the end product is the coffee itself and the caffeine is a by-product. It is just much cheaper to make the caffeine directly.

Ill be doing a future video on how to get caffeine from caffeine pills.

I am lazy and it is getting there. I have been spending most of my time focusing on filming new experiments, so I often forget about the other things.

The next thing that I put my money to is a proper vacuum pump. My current one smokes after running for 30 seconds. When I get a better pump, I will be able to do some proper vacuum distillations.

Today we will be making phosphorus tribromide (PBr3) from red phosphorus and bromine (made in a previous video). I am hoping to release a "wet" chemistry video every Saturday, and a "dry," more theory based chem video maybe on Tuesdays. Let me know what you guys think.

Next Saturday video is: lidocaine extraction from anal lubricant.

The synthesis procedure was taken from here: http://woelen.homescience.net/science/chem/exps/PBr3_synth/index.html

Happy New Years Eve everyone! 

In this video, we will be making some ammonia gas and condensing it to liquid ammonia. Then we'll be using the liquid ammonia to dissolve some sodium and lithium metal! I hope you guys enjoy!

In a future video, this liquid ammonia is then used for a quick birch reduction of benzene.

A photo of a typical mechanism: http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/media/vsc/en/ch/12/oc/radikale/birch_reduktion/birch_mechanismus_en.gif

Depending on the groups attached to the ring, the mechanism does change a little bit and it produces a product that is reduced at different places.

In this video, we extract some caffeine from caffeine pills. I was not happy with my yield of caffeine in the previous videos, so I chose a better source. I managed to get 8.5g of nice clean caffeine!

This video is kind of linked to my other video tutorial on extractions.

UPDATE: I had to do this again for more sulfuric acid. For boiling chips, I smashed a porcelain dish and the little pieces worked really well to keep things under control. No crazy bumping!

Hello everyone! So, a lot of people have been asking for this and finally it is here! In this video, we clean sulfuric acid using both the H2O2 method and distillation. It is a pretty long one and it took me a long time to edit .

<description>Duration: 12:56 (776s)<br/>Views: 224601<br/>Likes: 4171<br/><br/>Hello everyone! Today, we will be making some vanillin oxime, which is a precursor to capsaicin. My goal is to use it to make vanillylamine, but so far ive been having problems with it. Oh well. This video was supposed to be short, but it actually ended up taking  super long to make. I hope you guys enjoy!

I plan to do an Q and A video, so if you have any questions you'd like me to address in the video, leave them in the comments.

<description>Duration: 11:26 (686s)<br/>Views: 662375<br/>Likes: 13355<br/><br/>Note: A good portion of the MnO2 from these batteries is actually carbon. It still worked for my bromine synthesis, but it is something to keep in mind.

Hello everyone, In this video, I get manganese dioxide, zinc and carbon from Zinc-Carbon batteries. There is a significant amount of carbon in the MnO2. It is not worth the time to try to separate it out though, unless you need pure MnO2. I used the manganese dioxide to make some bromine. This was filmed in 4K and will be uploaded eventually. The MnO2 can also be used to generate oxygen from hydrogen peroxide. I go over this in my liquid oxygen video and oxygen generator video. 

I should add that this video was inspired from NurdRage's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knc1lSupAwQ

I plan to do an Q and A video, so if you have any questions you'd like me to address in the video, leave them in the comments.

<description>Duration: 13:44 (824s)<br/>Views: 443239<br/>Likes: 9176<br/><br/>In this video, we will be making lithium hydroxide by reacting lithium metal with water!

Lithium hydroxide is a precursor to lithium drugs. I plan to use the lithium hydroxide to make a drug that's used to treat bipolar disorder, and to make lithium peroxide, which is a CO2 absorber (reacts with CO2 and produces O2)

I plan to do an Q and A video, so if you have any questions you'd like me to address in the video, leave them in the comments.

It is a cool exercise, but it is definitely not a cost effective method of obtaining iodine. It is much cheaper to buy it directly if you can.

I am in no way advocating that this is the best way to clean old potassium. Also, there are always fire risks involved.

I also just made 300g+ more mercury thiocyanate to make a new Pharaoh's Snake video.

<description>Duration: 07:43 (463s)<br/>Views: 112152<br/>Likes: 2231<br/><br/>In this video we make some ammonium formate from ammonium carbonate and formic acid. It was supposed to be used to convert vanillin to vanillin amine, but there was a problem with the synthesis and it doesn't seem to work. The vanillin amine is a precursor to things like capsaicin and other spicy compounds.

I still thought the video might be interesting though, so I am posting it anyway. Let me know if you have any other cool ways to use ammonium formate

In this video, we whip up some bromine using sulfuric acid drain cleaner, MnO2 from batteries, and sodium bromide pool solution.

At around 8 minutes, it should be sodium bisulfate not potassium! I made a mistake.

Hey guys, today we will be cleaning up some of my mercury metal. Remember that when working with mercury, you need to be in a well ventilated area because it gives off a lot of fumes.

Cleaning mercury like this is dangerous for obvious reasons...so please don't try this

Also, all mercury waste must be dealt with appropriately. No pouring it down the drain!!

I forgot to post where I got the procedure: http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v09/p138_139.pdf

<description>Duration: 12:33 (753s)<br/>Views: 318533<br/>Likes: 6950<br/><br/>Hey guys, today we are going to be revisiting the synthesis of mercury thiocyanate. I won't be demonstrating it in the this video. Instead ill have a dedicated one for it soon. This is scaled up 10x compared to my previous one.

Old Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC3o2KgQstA

Warning: This experiments requires the handling of dangerous and volatile chemicals. It must only be carried out in a fume hood or outdoors.

All chemicals must be disposed of properly. Everything will be contaminated with mercury/mercury salts. NOTHING CAN GO DOWN THE DRAIN OR IN THE GARBAGE. Only carry out this experiment if you can dispose of the chemicals and combustion products properly.

Every step of this synthesis deals with dangerous or toxic materials. Gloves, safety glasses and a lab coat are mandatory.

Here is a video to show you how volatile elemental mercury is. It lets off a lot of vapor and breathing this must be avoided.

<description>Duration: 06:49 (409s)<br/>Views: 449629<br/>Likes: 11129<br/><br/>Hey guys, in this video we will be making a little bit of basic copper carbonate. To do this, we use copper sulfate pentahydrate and sodium carbonate (which was made in a previous video).

I will use this to make pyridine from niacin (vitamin B3). The main thing that I will use pyridine for is as an organic catalyst.

The calcium acetate that we make here is going to be used to make flammable jelly and acetone

Hey guys, I just wanted to throw this video out. It is just a clip from the  recent iodine clock video, but I thought it deserved to be its own standalone clip.

This is an example of what's known at the Iodine Clock Reaction and we aren't actually making real Coke here. Two colorless liquids are mixed and after a certain period of time, a sudden color change occurs.

Here is just a 2 minute clip of a piece of pork begin completely broken down by the hot piranha. This stuff is extremely dangerous to work with for obvious reasons. It can react explosively with certain organics (like solvents).

This piranha is a 3:1 mixture of 98% sulfuric acid to 35% hydrogen peroxide (by volume).

I should add, the reason I didn't just try to wash away the sugar with water is because it forms an insanely terrible suspension that is a pain to deal with or filter off.

I am also going to look a little into the weirdness of the wet niacin. 

Hey guys, today we will be getting some niacin from pills in order to make pyridine.

I had to order these pills online and it would make a lot more sense to just buy pure niacin at that point. If you are able to find niacin pills locally though, this method is viable.

<description>Duration: 08:38 (518s)<br/>Views: 203388<br/>Likes: 4065<br/><br/>Today we are making some pyridine from niacin. We use basic copper carbonate as a catalyst to get things going.

There is another method that is a lot more efficient, where a copper chromite catalyst is used and a video on this has been made by Doug's Lab. I opted not to use the copper chromite catalyst because it is a little harder to prepare. Apparently CaO might also be useable though, which would be pretty easy to make/get.

Also, Patreons are not charged for any of the non full length and in depth chemistry videos.

This video was just sitting around doing nothing, so I figured I would post it in celebration of hitting 50k subs. I do want to do a real and proper 50k celebration video, so that will be uploaded eventually.

When we soak the chicken in acid, the most interesting part is that the chicken turns white and appears cooked. The strong acid has a similar effect as heat which denatures the proteins that give the chicken its reddish color.

I also just noticed that the last video has almost the same thumbnail...oops

RIP. Always remember the flask and the heating mantle.

<description>Duration: 07:54 (474s)<br/>Views: 282904<br/>Likes: 5605<br/><br/>Here we do a scaled up version of the oxalic acid synthesis that ChemPlayer did. The table sugar (sucrose) is oxidized using nitric acid.

This is a pretty dirty reaction and it is not very efficient. Oxalic acid has various uses, but I want to use it to make oxalyl chloride, which will in turn be used to make TCPO which is used in glow stick.

The followup video to this one would be the azeotropic distillation of oxalic acid to dry it. In order to make oxalyl chloride, we need very dry oxalic acid (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAt9lO82s-0)

This method is meant mostly for demonstration purposes. I don't condone the use of Red P for any illegal purposes. Also, the Red P that we get isn't super pure. There are some other things mixed into it. 

The yield from this method is super low too, so you really won't be able to mass produce Red P. It it really only useful for the small scale experiments.

Also, just as a side-note, videos like these are no charged to Patreon supporters. It is free to everyone

To make the aluminum isopropoxide, I will use mercuric chloride that was made in a previous video. I will then carry out an MPV reduction using the aluminum isopropoxide to eventually make 1-octen-3-ol, something I have been working towards for a while.

NOTE: Around 5 minutes, I made a mistake and wrote "hydriodic acid" instead of "hydrogen gas"

This is a cool example of the Retro-Aldol reaction. This really is not a great way to get benzaldehyde though, and it is mostly just for educational purposes.

Today we are going to be playing with the redox indicator methylene blue. Instead of KOH, it can be replaced with NaOH. It just needs to be adjusted according to molar mass.

Today we are making some anisole! Anisole itself doesn't have many direct applications, and it's mostly used as a precursor to perfumes and pharmaceuticals.

I plan on using anisole to make anethole, which is 13x sweeter than regular sugar.

If you want the fastest way, follow chemplayers method. I just prefer to not evaporate solvents, but that takes extra time.

Hey guys, today we are starting on the journey from Aspirin to Tylenol.  I would use a gravity filtration though in both cases though. It's just as fast and doesn't have as many problems as a vacuum one. Still do a recrystallization though. Without a recryst/hot filtration, the ASA is still pretty dirty.

<description>Duration: 12:55 (775s)<br/>Views: 169288<br/>Likes: 2685<br/><br/>Hey guys, today we will be going over the second step in the quest to acetaminophen. In the previous video I extracted ASA from aspirin pills and now it is time to hydrolyze it to salicylic acid. This will be done by a simple acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis. The next step in this process is the decarboxylation to phenol.

<description>Duration: 19:53 (1193s)<br/>Views: 2873730<br/>Likes: 42098<br/><br/>UPDATE: It was brought to my attention a much much better way to store it. The mercury should be put in the bottle without adding water. The bottle is then stored in a bag full of sulfur. Storing it under water will inevitably lead to it becoming all gross again.

Okay, I am finally posting the mercury distillation video. This was obviously dangerous to do, so please don't try to repeat what you see here!

<title>Making a silver mirror</title>

<description>Duration: 15:05 (905s)<br/>Views: 1383664<br/>Likes: 27574<br/><br/>Today we will be doing a demonstration of the Tollen's test and use it to make a silver mirror. 

The Tollen's test is mainly used to identify aldehyde groups (forms a silver mirror) and it was historically used a lot. It was slowly replaced with more accurate and better techniques. However, it is still very useful for hobbyist who can't afford big expensive machines. The silver mirror is kind of an off-shoot of the Tollen test, where all we are after is the mirror that forms. We use glucose because it is a cheap and easy aldehyde source.

In the future, I might make a video where I identify an uknown chemical using a series of classic techniques.

We are making some dibenzalacetone, which is a commonly used sunscreen ingredient. It is very good at absorbing UV light, so it's good at protecting us from the mean sun.

The next video will be the 4th in the aspirin/paracetamol series.

<description>Duration: 29:18 (1758s)<br/>Views: 164280<br/>Likes: 2419<br/><br/>We are back again for the fourth installment! We will be doing the mono nitration of phenol, to get a mixture of p-nitrophenol and o-nitrophenol. The o-nitrophenol is separated off by steam distillation and the p-nitrophenol that is left over is cleaned by recrystallization.

This video turned out to be very long and it took me like 25 hours to edit it...so you should definitely watch all of it.

Also, acetaminophen = Paracetamol = Tylenol = APAP

<description>Duration: 16:20 (980s)<br/>Views: 7083485<br/>Likes: 126353<br/><br/>Today we are extracting citric acid from some large large lemons. Citric acid is quite a useful molecule in general, but I don't have any particular uses for it. It is mostly used as a pH buffering agent in chemistry and isn't use in direct synthesis. 

A buffering solution is a solution that resists pH change. It is useful in synthesis when you need to keep the pH relatively constant during a reaction.

In my Cadaverine video, I used citric acid to make a pH buffer solution: https://youtu.be/C5hxFAwKIzs

Using acetic anhydride, the p-aminophenol is going to be acetylated. The reaction is carried out in water at room temperature. 

Acetic anhydride does react with water, but it happens slowly. By including an excess of acetic anhydride, we can assure that the acetylation goes to completion.

<description>Duration: 18:03 (1083s)<br/>Views: 955965<br/>Likes: 21056<br/><br/>The Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction is one of the very few oscillating reactions that we know of. 

Throughout the reaction, the concentration of iodide (I-) goes up and down, and this causes a swap between 2 processes. The the concentration is high, the process that consumes iodide is favored. When it is low, the process that produces it is favored. This causes a constant fluctuation of iodide.

As the iodide increases, it forms I2 which is yellow, then the I2 eventually combines with I- to form I3. This complexes with starch and forms a blue-black complex. The iodide producing process is then shutdown and the process that consumes it takes over. The iodide concentration drops, the I3-starch complex falls apart and the color dissipates. The I2 is sequestered by malonic acid and the solution reverts to colorless. 

The [i-] continues to fall until the other process then takes over. Iodide is produced again and the cycle repeats itself.

NOTE: The yellow color of solution A was solved almost instantly by Bill Smathers. The iodate was likely contaminated with iodide. In acid, the lead to the production of I2, which gave the solution a yellow color. Upon addition of B, the I2 was sequestered by malonic acid!

<description>Duration: 18:09 (1089s)<br/>Views: 1605520<br/>Likes: 43627<br/><br/>In this video, we explore what milk is made of. It is a really interesting mixture of minerals, proteins, water, sugar, vitamins and fat. Nature has found a way to pack a crazy amount of calories, nutrients and food into a tiny package. 

Using a little bit of chemistry, each part can be isolated.

Lithium carbonate is a very useful medication used to treat bipolar disorder. In this video, I will be making lithium carbonate, first from lithium hydroxide and then from a battery.
 
Keep in mind that lithium salts affect the nervous system and working with lithium metal can be dangerous. This video is for educational purposes only and should not be repeated!

Also, adding lithium metal to water is dangerous. It can lead to a serious fire. Again, please do not repeat this.

In this video, I will be doing the classic Nylon 6,6 demonstration. I first convert adipic acid (which was made in a previous video) to adipoyl chloride. It is then reacted with hexamethylenediamine to form Nylon 6,6.

In the future, I will be making Nylon 6,6 the industrial way, by first going through the nylon salt.

Note: I write cyclohexanol in the video, but it is actually cyclohexane that I used. I also wrote in the comments it was cyclohexanol...so double mistake. oops

It was discovered in 1886 and sold under the brand name Antifebrin by the company Kalle &amp; Co. It has since been completely replaced by paracetamol/acetaminophen.

This is part2 of my soap series, where I'll be making liquid soap. If you haven't seen part 1, I strongly suggest that you check it out before this one. The major difference with liquid soap, is that it uses potassium hydroxide instead of sodium hydroxide.

I said ashes have sodium hydroxide in them, when they really have potassium carbonate, which is converted to potassium hydroxide by treatment with calcium hydroxide or oxide. 

I hate having to reupload, but the error was too big for me to let go. I do not like the idea of spreading misinformation. I hope you guys can understand!

This is my first attempt to do this and I think I will try it again in the future. I wouldn't use the same procedure though, because I don't think this one was too good. The high heat let to a lot of glycerol breaking down and I think a lot of side reactions.

Oddly enough, many lead compounds have a sweet taste. One of the most famous ones is probably lead acetate. It is highly water soluble and it looks and tastes like sugar.

I'll be making it in two ways:

1) Lead oxide + acetic acid
2) Lead metal + acetic acid + hydrogen peroxide

This process is not only cool to look at, but it also is really useful to extract gold from ore. The gold-mercury amalgam can then be isolated and the mercury is boiled off or removed chemically. This leaves behind relatively pure gold.

Instead of turning the adipic acid first into adipoyl chloride, I react it directly with hexamethylene diamine to make a nylon 6,6 salt. Then using heat, I force the salt to polymerize.

<description>Duration: 20:53 (1253s)<br/>Views: 4074489<br/>Likes: 78425<br/><br/>Today I'll be making some margarine from olive oil, however, it is going to be terrible and inedible. It is all about the journey though...right?

To make it, I'll be hydrogenating olive oil. Margarine is normally partially hydrogenated, but I am going to fully hydrogenate things. So, it's going to actually be closer to "shortening".

I was informed by some people that my way of making the margarine was terrible. I am probably going to try it again sometime, where I use a whisk (and froth it properly) and I'll do a partial hydrogenation.

<description>Duration: 08:50 (530s)<br/>Views: 54216794<br/>Likes: 601416<br/><br/>When mercury is added to aluminum, it forms an amalgam (a mercury alloy). Aluminum is normally protected by a thick oxide layer, but the formation of the amalgam disrupts it. It allows fresh aluminum to react with air to form white aluminum oxide. As the oxide grows, it forms as these cool white fibers.

Let me know what other element you would like to see. Keep in mind that this takes a lot of work though, and that not all elements will be possible (due to rarity and/or danger).

Let me know if I forgot anything in the description. I probably left out links or something.

In this video, I will be trying to recreate the popular explosive polymerization video. In this reaction, p-nitroaniline is heated over a flame with some sulfuric acid. Initially, not too much happens, but then suddenly, a large black snake appears. To do this, I will first need to make some p-nitroaniline, from acetanilide that I made in a previous video.

The foam that is formed is resistant to fire.

In this video, I talk about the myth that surrounds iodine, which has to be one of the most widely spread misconceptions in chemistry. It is often taught in class and even appears in textbooks.
I try to explain why this myth came to be and I offer a potential solution. This video took me a really really long time to make, so I hope you guys like it!

I'll be extracting DNA from strawberries and then giving it a taste to see what it's like. Because I plan to eat it, I only use chemicals that are "food safe".

On a side note, it feels like I have been neglecting synthesis, so the next few videos are  going to just synth projects only!

Today, I'm going to be exploring the science of azo dyes. This class of dyes is one of the most popular and it is used to dye clothing in a unique way. It is based on a reaction known as "azo coupling" where two dye components are developed directly on/in the textile fibers. The Para Red is not the best though and it is very prone to rubbing off and washing away. Because of this, other dyes are often used instead. Also, I used only one dye here, but combinations can sometimes be used to increase the vibrancy and "richness" of the color.

Both of the main starting chemicals can be made completely from scratch:
• p-nitroaniline: sodium benzoate -- benzene -- nitrobenzene -- aniline -- acetanilide -- p-nitroaniline
• 2-naphthol: naphthalene (moth balls) -- 2-naphthol

For the p-nitroaniline, I've done all the reactions in various videos over the years. The sodium benzoate that I start with is a very cheap and easy to get food preservative. I might make the 2-naphthol in a future video.

For this video, I am going to be making some laughing gas, aka nitrous oxide. Then, I'll be using it to carry out the classic Barking Dog experiment. To make it, I'll be using the safer method, which uses sodium nitrite and hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The typical industrial process, using ammonium nitrate, can be quite dangerous.

This video has been a long time coming and I am glad that I could finally release it. I have been promising people this forever!

This video is a special one and I made it specifically for World Diabetes Day, which happens every year on November 14. Diabetes was originally diagnosed by tasting the urine of patients. In diabetics, the blood-sugar level is often extremely high and some of it spills over into the urine. So, if the urine tasted sweet, the person was likely diabetic.

This was the main way to test for diabetes for a long time, until there was a breakthrough in 1841 by Karl Trommer. From there, the technology was continually improved and today we have blood glucose meters. I think that this technological journey is extremely interesting, and I hope that you guys agree with me after watching the video.

What I also think is cool, is that many of the breakthroughs along the way are still useful today for other applications. The Fehling's and Benedict solutions are still routinely used in analytical chemistry, and the test strips are also useful.

<title>Extracting urea from my own pee</title>

<description>Duration: 15:09 (909s)<br/>Views: 4515682<br/>Likes: 138073<br/><br/>Urea is the largest non-water component of pee and it's generated by the metabolism and breakdown of proteins. It's an extremely useful compound and it's used in many commercial products, from fertilizers to cold packs. Im going to be using it for chemical synthesis, to make Dulcin (a now banned artificial sweetener) and Dilantin (an anti-seizure medication). And maybe some other things.
I definitely think that it is weird to use something that was once part of me to build new chemicals. However, it is also pretty cool. On top of this, Ill be tasting the Dulcin, so things will go full circle.

Note: when I mention dilute nitric acid, it is a 50/50 mixture of conc. HNO3 (~65%) and water.

<description>Duration: 18:50 (1130s)<br/>Views: 2284795<br/>Likes: 68196<br/><br/>WARNING: Tasting chemicals that you make is almost always a bad idea. Even though I've taken several steps to make it as safe as possible, I'm still doing it at my own risk.

For this video, I'll be using the urea that I got in my last video, to make Dulcin. Dulcin was the second artificial sweetener to be discovered, but it's now banned due to health issues. My goal for this video is to make it using only easily sourced materials, and then to taste it at the end.

The prep for this video uses wintergreen (methyl salicylate) instead, which I made in an edible chem video.

In the previous video, the active chemical I made was TCPO. This required 2,4,6-trichlorophenol as a precursor, which is damaging to the environment.

After that razors are just a few bucks a month. 

In this video, I make some indigo and dye jeans and socks. 

For a long time, indigo was harvested from plants, but it was eventually synthesized. I'll be doing one of the early synthesis methods, which is easy, but not commercially viable. In the future, I might try out the modern industrial method.

In this video, I'll be going over the quick history of my channel and talk about how it got to where it is now.

I also give a quick tour of my old lab, as well as my new lab that I just finished building.

A big thanks goes out to everyone who has helped me and supported me along the way. All of your donations and kind words have been extremely helpful. This year has just begun, and I can't wait to see what it has in store for me.

About a year ago, I made a series where I chemically converted Aspirin to Tylenol (aka acetaminophen, paracetamol, or APAP). The original series was spread out over several videos and was over 90 minutes long. It has a lot more detail, but it was a much bigger commitment to watch.

<description>Duration: 13:42 (822s)<br/>Views: 2426266<br/>Likes: 73012<br/><br/>Today I'll be making Prussian Blue, which was the first modern synthetic pigment. For this video, I'll be isolating it and using it to make paint, but in the future, I''ll be diving into the whole process of cyanotyping.

<description>Duration: 15:16 (916s)<br/>Views: 1018971<br/>Likes: 30034<br/><br/>In this video, I'll be using the ferric chloride that I made in the last one, to make ferric ammonium citrate. This new iron compound is sensitive to UV and I'll use it to make my own blueprint. In the next and last video, I'll be making some high quality cyanotypes and exploring the process in more detail.

In this video, I'll be making DNBP, which is a photochromic compound. This means that it reversibly changes in color when its exposed to UV or sunlight. Once I made it, I tried out some cool things with it, like developing photos and making a color changing plastic.

*At the 5min mark, I say 1.5g phenanthroline monohydrate, but 5g is written. It is indeed 1.5g though.

About a year ago, I saw one of the weirdest reactions that I've ever seen. It was called the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, and it's one of the few good examples of an oscillating chemical reaction. I decided to try and do it myself, and this video summarizes the process that I used.

In this video, I'll be using the ferric ammonium citrate that I made to make "blueprints" of my own digital photos. Then, at the end, I'll try toning them with tea and coffee to change the color.

This process is called cyanotype or "blueprinting"

<description>Duration: 22:41 (1361s)<br/>Views: 2132645<br/>Likes: 45127<br/><br/>For this video, I decided to make Brooker’s Merocyanine, also called MOED, which exhibits solvatochromism. This means that it its color changes drastically, depending on the solvent that it’s dissolved in. I thought this effect was really cool and I wanted to try it out myself. Also, chemical companies sell it for hundreds of dollars a gram, and I wanted to see how much cheaper I could make it for.

I am going to be working more on this project, and I hope that soon I'll have an easy method to make it from relatively easy to get chemicals and supplies.

After seeing it, I was really interested in trying it out for myself, and well, I did. This is probably the longest video that I've ever posted on my channel, but I wanted it to be as complete as possible!

This video was originally released on Patreon on Nov. 10, before I left to Japan for vacation. I will be back on the 23rd though!

Correction: at 12:50 I said that pure nitrogen is denser than air, but that isn't true. The specific gravity of nitrogen vs dry air at STP is ~0.97, meaning that it should rise slightly, but the difference (0.97 vs 1) is so small that there isn't a very noticeable effect. When air is flushed out of a flask by nitrogen, it would take a while, but it should eventually mix with the air out of the flask.

For this video, I'll be making the sodium amalgam, which is commonly used in chemical reactions. It can also be used as a gateway to other amalgams, even some that are normally very hard to form. This is the first official video in my new amalgam series, where I try and combine as many different metals as possible with mercury.

Pepto-Bismol contains bismuth subsalicylate, and it's possible to extract the bismuth from it and use it to grow metal crystals.

This is a re-visit of a project that I attempted a few years ago: https://youtu.be/grpSfjUImUs

<description>Duration: 28:25 (1705s)<br/>Views: 7364781<br/>Likes: 172167<br/><br/>In this video, I get a bit back into making compounds with odors and scents. I chose to make perfume with Raspberry Ketone, because I thought it was an interesting molecule and the synthesis seemed fun. However, in the future, I think I'm going to venture into the territory of nasty smelling compounds. For some reason, I enjoy the suffering that they bring.

If metal has no odor and you can't smell it, then what are we smelling? It turns out that it's mostly a chemical called 1-octen-3-one, which is generated when your skin oils react with metal that you've touched. I thought this was really interesting, and I decided to try making pure 1-octen-3-one myself and to see what it smelled like.

A few months ago, one of my patrons sent me a bunch of old gold jewelry for me to refine. I originally thought that it was going to just be some gold plated stuff, but it turned out to be quite a bit of gold. I was able to purify out all of the gold and then melt them down into some small 24K pure gold bars.

It looks for any excuse to decompose and it reacts violently with most organic things. I tested it on a few things like cotton balls and paper, as well as solvents like acetone and ethanol. I also tried firing a small liquid rocket with it.

<description>Duration: 38:04 (2284s)<br/>Views: 14876584<br/>Likes: 314604<br/><br/>Back in October, I tried making ferrofluid but I kept failing and I ended up giving up for a while. Months later though, I got inspired, and I spent an insane amount of time researching ferrofluid and trying to make it. It was a very messy and sometimes frustrating process, but I was eventually successful. The method that I came up with still isn't perfect, but as far as I know, it's the best and most functional method available on the internet.

<description>Duration: 27:52 (1672s)<br/>Views: 5114248<br/>Likes: 129819<br/><br/>Sometime last year, I got really interested in microwave plasma, which can be made from a lot of things like lit matches, aluminum foil or just some grapes. However, when I went searching for more info about it, I really couldn't find much of anything. There was also no explanation as to why it was yellow every time, regardless of what it was made from. So, I decided to investigate this a little bit and try to get to the bottom of it.

<description>Duration: 36:57 (2217s)<br/>Views: 13692319<br/>Likes: 316111<br/><br/>**Major correction: I wrongly and repeatedly referred to T. Reesei as being a yeast, when it is actually another type of fungus. Yeast is also a type of fungus, so my comments about reaction conditions remain true, but it is incorrect to call T. Reesei a yeast. Or to say that the cellulase came from yeast. 

*Small correction: I also said that 20ml of 20% , when it was supposed to be 25ml.

For this video, I'm going to be doing exactly what the title says, and I'll be turning a roll of toilet paper into moonshine. This was something that I've been wanting to do for a while and I am really surprised how well it turned out!

For this project, I'll be making radioactive uranium glass, which was very popular 100 years ago. Under a blacklight, the uranium in it fluoresces to give off a nice green color. 

WARNING: Working with uranium and radioactive material is dangerous, and this video is for entertainment/educational purposes only. Please don't try and repeat what you see. Also, when the project is done, the waste needs to be dealt with and handled properly.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by things that glow in the dark. I had a few glow toys that I really liked, but I either lost them or gave them away. I could've just bought some new ones, but I thought it would be a lot more fun to make my own from scratch.

Note: In my equation for ZnS + O2, please ignore my explanation below it. It doesn't make sense.

I've always liked the taste of energy drinks and for years now, I have wanted there to be caffeine-free versions (specifically Red Bull). However, it doesn't seem like that is going to happen any time soon, so I decided to try and do it myself.

A few years ago, I saw a video about superconductors and it looked like anti-gravity magic. So, I decided to try and make some superconductors myself and to see if I could re-create the effect myself. In particular, I'll be making a YBCO superconductor, which is one of the few practical high-temperature superconductors.

<title>Does cyanide actually smell like almonds?</title>
<link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYagO-nup6c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">youtube:video:WYagO-nup6c</guid>

NOTE 1: I've attached a link below that covers some basic safety information about cyanide and how it was carefully handled when making this video.

NOTE 2: I have revised my opinion about what it smells like. In the video, I said it was like an indoor pool and I correlated it to the chlorine. However, I think it's more accurate to say the pool locker room or shower. It is musty/moldy, with a background of pool smell. 

NOTE 3: After posting this video, I got a few messages from people saying that in their experience, cyanide DOES smell like almonds. So, I spent an hour tonight doing some tests, and I think the results are interesting. I did some direct comparisons and the smell of cyanide is distinctly different from the smell of almonds. However, if I EAT the almonds, there is sometimes a faint taste of cyanide. I think this is because sweet almonds still have a very small amount of amygdalin in them, which can release HCN. I don't think it's enough to smell in open air, but in your mouth it can be concentrated enough to be detected at the back of the nose. It's subtle, but it is definitely part of the flavor profile. So, while I still don't think it's accurate to say that it smells like almonds, for some people, it might be similar to the taste. To make that connection though, the person needs to a) be able to smell HCN and b) be particularly aware of that part of the flavor.

I can smell the HCN, but I never noticed it in the flavor of almonds, so I didn't make the connection. I was even looking for a similarity and eating almonds at the same time, but never noticed it. It was only when I became very familiar with the smell of HCN that I started noticing it in almonds. What's interesting too, is that now after noticing it, I feel like I've started to associate the smell with almonds. It's no longer just a "chemical" smell and it feels more almondy. However, on the flip side, I feel like almonds taste worse and are more "chemically."

But either way, I still don't think that saying it smells like almonds or bitter almonds is accurate or helpful. However, based on the messages I've received, some people are naturally associating cyanide with almonds (sometimes without knowing that this was even a thing and not even knowing they were smelling cyanide). This has piqued my interest and I think it could be fun to get to the bottom of this and to do a trial with a lot more people.

Chemical transformations have always fascinated me and I've done a few (in my opinion) cool ones on this channel. For example, I turned my own pee into artificial sweetener and toilet paper into moonshine. For this one though, I'll be doing something that I've been wanting to do for years and I'll be turning plastic gloves into grape soda. 

Procedure:
• Phthalic acid/anhydride: Borrowed from Youtubers: NurdRage and UC235

When I started this channel, I worked in a lab. However, after I left that job I had to do all my chemistry and filming in my parents' garage. It was dangerous and sometimes scary, but lately, I've been feeling like I miss it. So, I decided to go back and make scary bromine (one of my favorite elements) in the garage and to see if I actually miss how things were.

However, it has a super low melting point of only about 30C (86F), so in a bowl of hot water, it should completely liquify. As a liquid, it kind of looks like mercury, but it's not nearly as toxic, and it's much safer to hold in my hand. However, it is a lot messier and tends to stick to things, and it leaves an annoying residue.

It's pretty common to combine sodium and mercury, which can be fun, and a bit dangerous. I did this on my main channel, and I basically just shoved sodium metal into mercury. The reaction generates a lot of heat, and it's usually enough to boil the mercury, and light the sodium on fire.

This is commonly done to purify gold, and separate it from raw ore. What I think is fun though, is to just throw some pure gold leaf into it. As the mercury dissolves the gold, it's slowly pulled in, and it kind of looks like the mercury is eating it.

But oddly enough, it doesn't work well when the acid is pure. This is because of something called passivation where layer of oxidized copper forms and it covers the surface and protects the copper. To get it going, I have to add some water, which will dissolve the protective layer and let the acid attack it. This more dilute acid can completely shred all the metal until it completely dissolves.

It can sometimes be found in it's pure form like this, but it's commonly found combined with something else, like iron or sulfur. Arsenic's very poisonous, and historically, it was pretty common to use it to kill people. People usually used arsenic trioxide though, because it was sold as a rat poison, and it was the easiest form to get a hold of.

Even in the stronger ones like habaneros, there's actually very little in each pepper. It's so strong that when I've tried it in its pure form, I don't even find it very spicy, and it kind of just hurts.

Turning plastic gloves into hot sauce is something that I've been wanting to do since I started this channel. I never attempted it though because I knew that it was going to be the longest and hardest project I've ever worked on. However, one day I randomly decided that I was ready and I just got started on it...

What's kind of weird is that this little box, is even more radioactive, but it isn't filled with a bunch of pure radioactive material, and it's just some old watch hands. However these watch hands, are painted with something called radium, that's 1000000x more radioactive than uranium.

It's a chemical used to put out fires in places like museums and server rooms because it evaporates without damaging things like paper, and doesn't mess up electronics.

<description>Duration: 00:49 (49s)<br/>Views: 173701743<br/>Likes: 5584558<br/><br/>Ice normally floats on water because as water freezes it expands, and the density of the solid becomes less than the liquid. This on the other hand is an ice cube that I made, but this one's kind of special, and it's able to sink.

This is because it isn't normal water, and it's actually heavy water. This heavy water (D2O), is made when the hydrogen of regular water (H2O) is replaced with deuterium, which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Heavy water is about 11% denser than regular water (H20), and this extra weight lets it sink.

<description>Duration: 01:00 (60s)<br/>Views: 41068547<br/>Likes: 2773067<br/><br/>A little while ago I made something called an atomic trampoline, and I think it's pretty cool. This is because when you drop something on it like a ball bearing, it just keeps on bouncing like it's never going to stop.

What I've been really wanting to do though is take two of the trampolines that I've made, and see if anything weird happens, if I try bouncing a ball bearing between them.

3) Dry it,  put it on a hot plate, and turn on the heat
4) Gold???

Unfortunately, even though it really looks like it, it isn't real gold. It's actually brass, and it formed because the heat caused the zinc coating, to combine with the copper in the penny.

Ever since then I've always wanted to free the uranium, and I've randomly decided that today is the day to crack it open, but I have to be careful. This is because once the uranium is exposed to air it reacts to form small particles of radioactive uranium oxide, which are really dangerous and not good to breathe in.

The only problem was that it also damaged my glass beaker, and now, I have to sacrifice it. I don't want it to completely go to waste though, and I've decided to try and recycle pieces of it, by melting them in a microwave.

Dissolving this gold bar is actually part of the process that I did to make purple gold!

This was actually all just nylon plastic, but I still feel that it looked kind of nasty. What I didn't try though, and what I think could be cool, is to add something called fluorescein.

To pop it, it's the same as regular popcorn, and all I have to do is put the whole cob in the microwave.

NOTE: It's important that the penny needs to be pure copper. If it's made with zinc, it will melt.
