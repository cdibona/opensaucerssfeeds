These jeans of mine had seen better days, but with a little epoxy and a quick turn on the lathe, I turn them into something unique!

I originally sprayed it with lacquer, but it just wasn't right. So I sanded it off and left it unfinished. The patterns that you get from the layers of denim is quite interesting!

The original idea was to use nails as the stems for tippe tops and shape them on the belt sander with my hand drill.  I had hoped to do a production run of tippe tops this way and make a cool video in the process. The thing about new ideas is not all of them work. Anyone need a much of walnut squares with nails epoxied in?

Paper micarta is the proper term for it, but it doesn't really capture the essence of the idea. Those 400 pages hold but a single story, and now they can upright a device capable of holding thousands of stories. 

Really it's the ultimate upcycling!

And with only a book and 30 some odd ounces of epoxy, you can make your own!

<description>Duration: 04:58 (298s)<br/>Views: 119876<br/>Likes: 1449<br/><br/>Making an ironwood wand. Ironwood is extremely hard type of wood. It is normally heavy, oily and due to the high silica content quite rough on the tools. All that being said, if you take your time and work hard to get it all polished up it is a beautiful looking wood. This wand is laminated with a 1/4 piece of oak and finished with a coat of wipe on poly.

Also, 'iron' woods are the only woods that are heavy enough to sink in water.

Science lesson over, lets turn a wand...

I take the time to rearrange this shop this for the first time since I moved in it, back in April of 2013. I now have almost 5 feet of cut behind and in front of the table saw, as well as an open spot by the door. My hope is that this will allow me to maybe work on some slightly larger projects for the future...

My box is scaled down quite a bit, but fits well in the shop. It is 22.5" high, 16" wide and 11.5" deep. It is perfect for reaching to the top of the lumber rack, changing light bulbs, as well as sitting at the bench or for a step up to tools and tables for young woodworkers.

You just as easily press this into sheet material for use in box inlays or scroll saw art. The possibilities are endless. The total processing time was under an hour from bottle to blank! Less than waiting for a glue up.

The result is a stunningly colorful blank!

<description>Duration: 04:45 (285s)<br/>Views: 64113<br/>Likes: 995<br/><br/>My main motivation was to try something different with the HDPE than just turning it on the lathe. I wanted to incorporate it into a traditional woodworking piece as a accent. 

This is a maple and jatoba wall clock with 4 -1" HDPE inlays. The style has a retro feel to it that the colors help to sell.

It was great in theory, but proved quite tricky in actual application.
Next time, I'd just screw in the HDPE from the back and plug those hole with a dowel, instead of trying to be all clever....  

I've got some more idea for using this material in non-conventional ways, so hopefully this will not be the last of my HDPE experiments...

Every man I've ever met has had a secret fantasy that some old codger would find him one day, hand him a laser sword and explain he was the last person in the galaxy with the ability to save the universe from total destruction. 

That's what Star Wars is to me. A boyhood fantasy complete with blasters and Jedi mind tricks.

More detail can be seen on my website below! 

It's ready to hang on your tree. Or not. I'm really not sure if it's smart to hang a wooden ornament with a light stuck in it on my Christmas tree. I'm sure something will tell me....

The woods used in this drum are oak, mahogany and acacia. I had an allergic reaction to the acacia and had to buy a respirator to finish the project! 

Had that not happened I might have used acacia for the whole drum. Personally I prefer the mixed look, and now I have enough acacia left over for some future projects!

The handle of the mallet is made from a cherry board and adds a nice warm contrast to the plastic! This mallet packs a punch and is quite heavy given it smaller size!

I don't think I was quite prepared for how colorful this project would end up or how much of a mess it would leave in the shop! Still, I'm quite pleased with it.

My daughter was the only one who protested... "Dad, you used ALL the sprinkles?!"

Well, it's pretty easy to get it into flat material for the shop. I flattened a 4" piece of schedule 40 PVC in about 20 minutes. You just need a heat gun and a flat surface.

Odds are, you've got loads of the stuff sitting around the house. Why not recycle it into something useful?

I picked a bracelet as jewelry seemed like the best choice for an object that might end up at a party. A business accessory in the daylight and party bangle in the black light!

I wanted a project to challenge me and this fit the bill. The final size is 34" in diameter and quite a striking addition to the wall.

The epoxy I used is not rated for sustained food contact, so simply add a piece of wax paper under you cake.

The top measures 11" in diameter and it's about 5" high. Also the resin top is not secured to the base to allow each piece to be used individually as well! 

If you like this, please share it. If it does well, I'll keep making quick epoxy dipping projects in addition to my other projects.

http://www.instructables.com

The tour was 2 hours and I could only put so much of it in the video, but I tired to instill my general sense of awe that I felt while walking around the building! I think my only regret was not trying the zip trolley for myself... 

Thank you all for having me and thanks especially to Mike Warren for his time!

I started with some hard maple 3" square and 1" thick. Honestly, 3/4" stock would be more than enough. I also got to give my little Dremel a workout!

It was a huge success, and easily burned through shop towels and craft paper. Getting that footage on camera...well it was a bit more of a trick. Even with a polarizing filter on my camera lens it was hard to get a clear view of the blinding light.

Oh, and *Please don't try this at home*

<title>The Herringbone Dilemma</title>

<description>Duration: 09:10 (550s)<br/>Views: 621614<br/>Likes: 8959<br/><br/>I take a walnut board and make it into a large blank for a turned box. 

The end grain herringbone pattern is achieved by cross-cutting 2" lengths from a 13"x11" walnut board and stacking them on end, to make something quite dramatic looking from a fairly common board!

Be sure to vote:  Team Cutting Board Or Team Box?! 

I will check the comments Saturday night, Jan 9th 2016 for a final tally. The choice of what I make, lies with you!

So the results came in and you decided on a box!  It came out amazing and I love the way the herringbone pattern looks in walnut. It is quite exotic!

The final dimensions of this box are 5 inches in diameter and 2 inches high. I used two coats of boiled linseed oil as the finish, and it gives the box a very warm feel.

So back when I made the Batman Spatula, I had also planned to make a Deadpool one. But, my CNC broke down and the project died along with it. Since I recently bought a scroll saw and needed a first project, I decided to revive Wade and give it a go.

It's now a comfortable, yet rustic coffee table for my patio room. I'm more than pleased with it. I'm also happy to have reclaimed some trash and made of use again.

This is about 8 or so milk bottles that I had previously cut up and melted but never used. Now that I got a block started it seems silly not to make put this great material to use.

Now the Internet is brilliant at many things, but it has been a huge devastation to revealing magic tricks. What I'm showing isn't anything that hasn't been shown already and could be found with a very rudimentary web search. 

That being said, if you see someone doing magic, try not to ruin it for the other spectators...

The cracked effect from the salt, makes for a lamp with extreme visual interest in the day and night. And yes, I cleaned every inch of the shop up. Still there is sure to be some rusting...

The process wasn't easy for me, but the end result is a satisfying tool with a handle made from milk!

But it is easily cleaned up!  Inside of 20 minutes you can have your tool surface clear of rust, and protected with some light oil.

It's made with some scrap wood and a few bolts and t-nuts from the hardware store. It will take a couple hours to make, but will save many frustrating sessions finishing up your bowls.

I suppose I should just get this one off my list...

I bought some redwood 1x12's and cut and fit them for Mrs. Browns decorative garden bench. A simple project that really adds some interest to our front yard.

See, I told you I'd do it...

Turning with a strobe light is a very cool effect! It allows you to better see the piece as you are working with it, but is a very strange way to work. I cannot recommend this as anything other than just a fun novelty and 2 mins of entertainment!

Before you ask: I had tried this a while back with some old wood glue and it didn't stick to anything on mat, so I thought I'd give the experiment another try with resin. The resin was much more effective! The only thing it missed, was a bit of silicone molding material, so I scraped it off with a wooden stir stick...

It's a model of a VW Bug cast in clear polyester resin. Then Markus turns it on the lathe while I supervise and ask questions about gummy bears and German cities...

This medium was suggested to me by Jeff @ TAOFLEDERMAUS and I knew I had to try it! The shop has never been this messy or smelled this good. Now, I'm off  to find someone willing to clean up all this candy.

Making a clipboard out of paper, crayons and 10oz of resin! I love the colors in this piece and had a lot of fun making it. Even if I might have gotten a bit crazy with the blow torch! 

I also got to try out a new resin, and was super excited at the lack of fumes!

I start with an 11" ash bowl blank and end up with a unique piece of art. Honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about it, so I'm letting you decide.

This bowl is made from splintered walnut and polyester resin. I ended up making a very large blank and turning most of it away! While I'm more than pleased by the end result, I think I could have minimized the resin usage with a bit of planning...

Regardless, I ended up with a cool and unique bowl! I hope you enjoy this video. I know I enjoyed making it

These started out as a resin project but ended up becoming much simpler. Honestly, I don't think they would have looked near as good had I gone with my original concept!

It came out amazing. We are now one step closer to cloning a dinosaur! 

This collaboration between myself and pocket took us 2 years to pull off due to various setbacks and issues! It's great to finally be able to show this to you, as not talking about it for this long has been hard for me!

<description>Duration: 10:04 (604s)<br/>Views: 230506<br/>Likes: 8015<br/><br/>I picked up the steel at a local salvage yard and the redwood fence posts at the Home Depot. The majority of the time spent on this project was me screwing up the nerve to start welding. 

I'm a fan of MIG love the sound and thoroughly enjoyed melting metal in the shop! I guarantee you will see more of this. 

Mrs. Brown was huge in helping me finalize the joining method with the carpenter shims and the leveling feet. She was the voice of reason, to keep me from freaking out at the last mile.

As I know someone will ask. Evolution sent me a saw last year, and Hobart sent me a welder. No one paid me to make this video and I purchased the steel for the welding table, gas for the welder and the cart to set it all on. If either of them does sponsor an episode, I will disclose that in the video.

I hadn't taken my camera out of the shop for a long time, so I'm not great with all my shots and sound but I'm hoping you can overlook that. 

I had a great time meeting and talking with everyone and you can bet I'll be back next year!

I tried tipping and the propane torch but I found for me the heat gun was the easiest method that yielded the best results. I know this will not be my last piece of resin wall art and I would encourage anyone wanting to make art to try this method.

It wasn't quite the 3 easy steps I was promised, but I believe I've found a method that works very well and should be repeatable for anyone else who wants to attempt it. Just a note, we waited for a full 24 hours from the last pour till cracking the egg open.

In the end, my blank was much larger than needed. Still with only a handful of denim squares and about 5oz of resin this was a very inexpensive project. Even with the larger than need blank!

It is a fun process and with a template covered in packing tape the cement dries and releases brilliantly! I would love to hear some thoughts on other projects I could make with this or other experiments you would like to see me try!

I'm super pleased with the results! Let me know what you think.

I had planned to do a welding project this week, but my main power is having issues and I cannot even run the clothes dryer, let alone my MIG welder. 

So, I decided to give this experiment a try that I've had rattling around in my brain for a while. Let me know what you think!

Most people who I show this to are surprised to learn it isn't stone. I think there are a lot of possibilities left for this material. If you give it a shot, let me know. I've love to hear how it turns out for you!

I love the material, and how the dye brings a depth to the cotton that is much harder to see in the non-dyed version. Overall, I feel there are still loads of possibilities for this material. I doubt I'm done with it.

It allows us to work with soft or otherwise unworkable woods that just wouldn't hold up to turning or other types of machining.

A while back I showed you a failure that we turned into a bottle stopper. You asked me to supersize that project. 

So, today we're going big time! A boiling resin lava bowl!

I've been wanting to do this for a while. We just walked into a random thrift store and each bought one item we could find. The challenge is simple, take that item and make it better. 

Did we succeed or fail?

For me, It's just a cool-looking bowl. Approx 8.5" inches in diameter and 5.5 inches deep.

I've been wanting to stabilize corn cobs for a while. It isn't uncommon but it was a first for me. It was also the first time I'd successfully dyed a blank with my stabilizing setup. I will definitely have to try that again!  

Let me know what other projects I do with these corn blanks. I'm having trouble coming up with something clever...

Learning from others is a lot of what makes YouTube such an inspiring community.  If someone has an opinion and wants to share it I appreciate it. Even if that opinion is, "I didn't really like this."

<description>Duration: 11:37 (697s)<br/>Views: 487131<br/>Likes: 25712<br/><br/>This is my version of a Minecraft Redstone Torch. It is made from polyester resin and redwood. The final dimensions are roughly  3" x 3" x 14"  and I feel like it really gives off the blockish look of the game torch. 

This idea has been on my list for a long time and I'm super happy with how it turned out. 

Thanks for looking!

I used tissue paper and resin a few years back, so I figured it should. Really happy with this project. It was a super easy craft that you can make with just a few simple supplies.

Let's talk about that!

This is what a simple project looks like. It was going to be put out in the 4 days I had off before the end of 2018. Obviously, I greatly overestimated my chances. 

As it stands, I couldn't be happier. I've learned a new technique, and I think I can even apply this failure to future projects. So, I'll rack this up in the win column!

In July of 2018 a viewer sent me out a bag full of brass shavings after he watched my aluminum shaving bowl video. I thought it would be really fun to try this combo as a table top.

I also got a chance to give my welder another workout. I have to save, between the largest resin pour I've ever done and my first crack at wielding a table leg, I am very happy with how this all turned out. 

Since the pigment I used is slightly transparent you really get a cool depth to this project. I sort of get lost staring at the patterns.

This has quickly become one of my favorite pens I've ever made. It just shines with depth and color and is smooth as glass. I rarely have a project without some little thing I would change or do differently. I can't think of anything I don't like about this one!

The lids allowed me to take some artistic license and play with some idea on a smaller scale. I love how different they all are. They're unique interesting and would recommend folks experiment. Having such a small canvas allows you to branch out ideas without much cost.

Honestly, I understand how it works, it still feels like actual magic. At least low-level alchemy.  Also, it's fun and quite doable in a small shop.

Normally I would leave the flamingo in the bath for 3-4 hours to get a nice solid copper coating as I achieved in the last video. One hour and 20 minutes gave me 50Gigs of footage. That's plenty for me...  :)

For the last 4 years, you have been asking me to dip a rose in resin. Accomplishing a pour of that volume without hard lines or overheating might be a singularly difficult pour.

I first found this and posted in 2020 on Instagram. Back then I asked the bookstore owner where he got the chairs. He said he found them both for sale years ago in a local thrift store. Was in the shop again last night and now only one remains.

Obviously they didn't help her back much. :)</description>
